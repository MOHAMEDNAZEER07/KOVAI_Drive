I have created a insight notebook giving insights with visualizations on the dataset to make it easier to understand the data.

there are 5 key insights in the insights.ipynb file.

I have also created a time series forecasting script and a notebook to help with forecasting.
where i have analysed the data and chose the best forecasting model for the dataset, which is Sarima because of the seasonality of the data.

and i used the log to stabilize the variance of the data and make the forcasting of total number of journeys more accurate.
